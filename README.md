# Because Coloring Books Are Too Boring... #

We, Ivan Ivanov and Milen Ferev, are developing a scientific project which solves the Graph Coloring problem using parallelized metaheuristic algorithms. The algorithms are optimized for the current working system and then benchmarked. Currently, a **Genetic** algorithm and an **Ant Colony Optimization** algorithm are implemented. They are still being optimized to fit our needs.

Also, a visualizer written in Python is provided which will present the colored graph to the user.


#Acknoledgements#

The project is started under the instruction of Emil Kelevedjiev, a researcher in the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Other supporters are Konstantin Delchev as a scientific advisor and HSSIMI.

Currently, our mentor is Dr. Stoyan Vellev from SAP Labs Bulgaria.
